A framework proposal will be presented, where information from every electronic communication (e.g. emails) will be extracted, modelled and correlated to trade events (time series) and other commercial activities from different data sources, trying to find entities to link these data, and possible current or new compliance issues. It is worth to mention that a demo of the framework operation will be introduced here, but further development is needed to achieve the desired functionality.
